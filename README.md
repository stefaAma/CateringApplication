# Catering Application

This GUI-equipped application is the result of the requirements analysis phase of two use cases, the subsequent design phase, and finally the implementation, all in a Unified Process perspective. The first use case was carried out during a university course called Development of Software Applications, while the second was assigned as part of the exam project.

## Course description

The course contributes to the goals of the "Corso di Laurea in Informatica" by supplying the concepts of Software Engineering and software development, based on the Unified Process (UP) Agile methodology, which adopts UML as its main modeling language. Therefore, the course supplies the theoretical and practical competencies to develop a non-trivial application by clearly identifying its business logic, database interactions, and other interfaces needed to fulfill the requirements. Moreover, they will learn how to build and manage a project plan taking into account the development team, the goals, and the development phases.
